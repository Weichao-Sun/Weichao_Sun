                <img src="images\AdobeStock_261497775.jpeg" alt="AdobeStock_261497775">
                <p>Dental implants are a permanent solution for missing teeth. They consist of titanium posts that are surgically placed into the jawbone, acting as artificial tooth roots. Once healed, crowns are attached to these posts, creating natural-looking replacement teeth.</p>
                <p>Benefits of dental implants include improved appearance, better speech, enhanced comfort, easier eating, and improved oral health. They are designed to blend seamlessly with your natural teeth and can last a lifetime with proper care.</p>
